[Homework](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-public-holidays-app/?utm_source=calendar.reactpractice.dev&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=calendar-v1)

Build a React application that shows the national holidays for the current year, for a given country.

The main screen should show:
- a dropdown with a list of countries
- a list of public holidays for the selected country

# What I have done:
- Got an array of Countries from this [API](https://openholidaysapi.org/swagger/index.html)

# Next:
- Use the array of countries to render dropdown menu.
- React query
